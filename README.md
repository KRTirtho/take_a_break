# take_a_break

Bro Take a Break. Or I'll break your neck cause someday you'll break it anyway from overworking or overwatching (cat videos).


## Features

Set a timer for every day, and it will remind you to take a break. It'll make you to take a break.
Also it'll give a ignore list for those websites or apps that you don't want to be reminded to take a break 
from like meeting apps or something (Don't be so happy. We know tinder isn't a meeting app. So we won't let you ignore it.)
